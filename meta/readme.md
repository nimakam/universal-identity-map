# Meta

The topic contains the collection of meta information needed to make sense of the map's structure, its individual parts, and high level concepts.

## Meta-concepts

Here we define the concepts needed for building an objective meta-map of how our effort makes sense of the world. This high level perspective helps describe different aspects of the external world such as markets and ecosystems.

### Perspectives

🛤 Perspectives refer to the patterns and viewpoints used to understand and influence external  realities. They often align with the individual disciplines represented in most major businesses, as well as reflected in organization structures at the leadership level.
Below are the list of perspectives followed by the significant  topics they encompass:

- **Industry** - Ecosystem, stakeholders, incentives, alliances, power dynamics, game-theory, standards
- **Market** - Audiences, needs, wants, use cases, positioning, promotion, branding, pricing, psychographics
- **Design** - Personas, experiences, sentiment, brands, habits, mental maps
- **Security** - Expected outcomes, risks, vulnerabilities, damages, mitigations
- **Product** - Solutions, Products and services, interfaces, delivery, user-tasks, features, state and storage, specifications, support
- **Business model** - Customers, agreements, transactions, income, costs, profits, pricing, strategy
- **Operations** - Procedures, logistics, projects, waste-minimization, scenarios
- **Engineering** - Architecture, infrastructure, building, fixing, upgrading, maintaining, monitoring, servicing, scenarios
- **Organization** - Vision, mission, culture, leadership, functional orgs
- **Information** - Concepts, structures, descriptions, contexts, instructions
- **Narrative** - Worldview, memes, media, public positions, founding myth
- **Jurisdiction** - Legal entity, governance, compliance, taxes, lobbying


### Domains

☯️ Domains refer to high level areas of knowledge and skills that have to do with differences in nature of the main subject matters, namely: humans, technologies and the economy.

![Domains and examples][domains]

[domains]: images/domains@500w.png

#### Human

🧑 The general discipline of design and humanities deals with humans as subjects, and accounts for their unique nature in its embedded areas of knowledge and skills. This set of skills is often represented in businesses by graphical or industrial design teams under product organizations.

#### Technology

📡 The general discipline of engineering aims to domesticate technologies and deal with their diversely unique natures, through its various sub-disciplines. These days, engineering organizations are a major source of competitive advantage in technology companies.

#### Economy

💸 "The economy" can be defined as the greater set of economic interactions in human society, which are mostly monetary. It is the subject of endless policy and business strategy discussions. Disciples of the more general "business" discipline, seek knowledge and skills to understand, manage and interact with aspects of the economy. Sub areas include marketing, business development, strategy, organizational management, public relations, etc.

Many types of careers fit nicely within one of the above domains. One factor contributing to the above observation is the extended amount of time and resources required to master any discipline within a domain. Another factor is the fundamental differences in the nature of the domain's subjects, which generally means that a disciple of each of these domains fits an approximate psychological profile. For example, those interested in understanding human beings are likely to become disciples of design or humanities.

### Basic lenses

👓 At the lowest level, most domains and and perspectives can be viewed and broken down using the elemental lenses described below. These are used to analyze and model the world and ultimately better predict future trends.

For example, the systems lens is the most prevalent way to look at the world when it comes to engineering. Or the design perspective takes advantage of the cognitive view when tackling user interactions and experiences.

#### Systems

Or mechanics is a generalized systems-based view of analysis and modeling. It starts with viewing actors as systems that interact and which in turn have organized functional components.

#### Economics

A generalized economics-based view of analysis and modeling. It starts with the view

#### Cognition

🧠 A human view focusing specifically on state of human minds involved and the acts of interaction and communication between them. In most cases this view can further be broken down and recomposed back into the systems and economics views.

#### Probability

Is a view focused on assigning probabilities to future and seemingly random events. It is the primary view used to build prediction models in order to invest wisely in future outcomes for highest returns.

### Basic tools

🛠  These are the fundamental tools used in most or all of the various disciplines, in order to build an objective understanding of the area, and be able to reason about applying changes to them.

#### Analysis

Breaking down areas and systems into their parts based on environmental and historical data. The process helps identify independent variables attributed to specific agents or environmental forces, as well as starting to experiment with the outcomes of making changes to those variables.

#### Modeling

Understanding systems and their interactions with the world by modeling their components as well as interactions. This often involves recognizing the things, patterns, actors and behaviors that consistently describe those interactions, and building objective models of these. The models can in turn be tested for validity and usefulness as their output is compared to real world historical data.

#### Optimization

Determining a set of goals and metrics and optimizing a known model to maximize said goals and metrics. Maximizing profit for a business model can be one example of using optimization as a tool. Waste-minimization in an operational process can be considered as another example. Simplifying a user interface for minimal cognitive overhead is yet another example of its use.

#### Prediction

Enables more effectively planning for seemingly random future events. For example, optimizing on future economic outcomes are most effective when paired with a sound probabilistic model of outcome and formal prediction mechanisms. Of course these mechanisms will be based on historic data and assumptions that may prove incorrect, however probabilistically they give us the best odds given we iterate them following learnings from external data and assumption tests.

## Meta-map

🗺 The comprehensive map we are putting together should encompass all levels of activity in the industry, starting from the very top level (industry itself), continuing to the various ecosystems, underlying markets and use-cases, and drilling down to the specific products, scenarios and features.
At all of these levels we will be able to apply the lenses, tools and perspectives described above, in order to build an even more comprehensive understanding.

![Meta map and examples][meta-map]

### Levels

🎚 There is a certain hierarchy to the map with multiple levels corresponding to different economic orders of magnitude, in terms of each space's activities. The exact dollar calculation for each level activity would not be precise or even feasible in some cases. Nonetheless we have included approximate values for for illustrative purposes only, and so these numbers should not be taken too seriously.

![Map levels][map-levels]

[map-levels]: images/map-levels.png

Below are the levels used in the map below, followed by their estimated economic order of magnitude:

- **Industry** - $100B-$1T
- **Ecosystem** -by technology wave and/or segment - $10B-$100B
- **Market** - by solution or product category- $1B-$10B
- **Use case** - $100M–$1B - may be served by multiple competing products
- **Product** - $100M-$1B - may be satisfying multiple use cases
- **Scenario** - $10M-$100M
- **Feature** - $1M - $10M
- **Sub-scenario** - $100K- $1M
- **Sub-feature** - $10K- $100K

### Industry

⚙️ The industry scope represent the space of all activities related to a specific and related set of human needs, as well as all the businesses and offerings that add value in that general area. The greater space may encompass vastly different customers, modes of delivery and technologies, each of which will form a separate segment, ecosystem or technology wave.
For example, the identity industry pertains to all of the businesses and offerings that focus on adding value to the greater economy through the uptake, usage and support of identity systems. 

### Ecosystem

The ecosystem perspective focuses on the significant relations and interactions between the industry players.

The space can be divided into the consumer, business and government segments, or separately separated based on the type of technology (digital, physical, etc) and technology wave (on-premise, web 2.0, etc).

#### Technology wave

Trends, assumptions, etc

#### Segment

Although segments are defined within markets, some ecosystems do not have cross segment activity, and can also be cleanly subdivided into sub-ecosystems corresponding to each given market segment. In such cases we can safely deal with segment ecosystems as mostly separate spaces. For example the identity ecosystems for consumer and business are generally independent in terms of economic activity, so we consider them separately.

### Market

The market scope represents the space of all activities meant to provide offerings for a specific set of use cases, within a given industry. The market will have providers on one side, and customers on the other, who in turn make the decision to purchase and use an offering. This may take the form of one or many solutions or products from various providers.

#### Segment

#### Use case

Product

#### Scenario

#### Feature

### Entity

Entities represent the private goods or public goods organizations that may exist at various levels of the map. 

For example, standards organizations are public good entities, that exist at the ecosystem level and help in developing that ecosystem by allowing market participants to benefit from predictable interoperability rules. Technology companies are often for-profit private goods organizations that focus on introducing products to one or many markets and each of which fulfills a given use case.

#### Worldview

Vision, mission, goals

#### Competencies

#### Brand

Universal Identity - aspirational and descriptive name for a universally interoperable identity protocol enabling a large and increasing number of digital use cases.

## Methodology

Building the mentioned industry map is essential to our approach at Universal Identity. We take the following general approach to building understanding across a number of dimensions, as well as planning and building for the future:

### Problem

Formulate and iterate on a clear, concise and applicable problem statement. This can be achieved through, analyzing and modeling the ecosystem, markets, stakeholders, users and security, as well as understanding the what users and customers go through. As part of this effort we will have developed a multi-layer map describing the different aspect of the industry, ecosystems, markets, and products.

### Solution

Define a set of products, standards and business models, based on the understanding established above. Being armed with a clear map of the industry and ecosystems, allows for a more effective solution definition.

### Implementation

For each of the major ecosystem entities and their products, plan for operations, engineering, organizations and information dissemination. Start off the ecosystem by implementing the public organization's products such as standards, reference information and source code, as well as helping any private vertical pieces required for initial usage.

Parts of these steps may occur in parallel or out of order, however the general sequence remains as shown above. Throughout this effort the map of industry in its current and future forms comes together gradually.

## Charting a new course

As part of proposing a solution to a problem, one has to provide detailed prescriptions around missing pieces or required changes in approach. For example in the case of proposing a new wave of identity systems, based on the decentralized digital wave of technologies, we have the opportunity to describe the essential pieces of such a new ecosystem. We also have the chance to prescribe the implementation of the parts that will likely kickstart it into existence that result in solving the current wave's problems.

Generally the decentralized identity movement intends to define and create a new identity ecosystem for the web 3.0 wave of technologies. Helping lead the creation of a whole new ecosystem is quite ambitious and requires ample preparation and perseverance. Part of what determines the success of such an effort is the clarity of the map visualizing its future state, and the road to get there. Every assumption and detail has to be thought out throughly and tested against historical data of previous ecosystems based on older waves of technology.

Some key determinants of success will be the correctness of predicted ecosystem structures, standards, and key entities that will drive the ecosystem's creation and growing traction past a tipping point.
